嵌套滚动是 Android OS 5.0之后，google 为我们提供的新特性。这种机制打破了我们对之前 Android 传统的事件处理的认知。从一定意义上可以理解为嵌套滚动是逆向的事件传递机制。
![](Android嵌套滚动入门/nestedscrolling.jpg)
如上图所示，其原理就是这样。那么下边我们从代码的层面看一下实现。
```java
public interface NestedScrollingChild {
    /**
     * 设置是否启用嵌套滚动
     */
    public void setNestedScrollingEnabled(boolean enabled);

    /**
     * 判断是否启用嵌套滚动
     */
    public boolean isNestedScrollingEnabled();

    /**
     * 开始嵌套滚动      
     * @param axes 标识方向，有 x, y 方形和默认值0
     */
    public boolean startNestedScroll(int axes);

    /**
     * 嵌套滚动结束
     */
    public void stopNestedScroll();

    /**        
     *  判断父 view 是否支持嵌套滚动
     */
    public boolean hasNestedScrollingParent();

    /**
     * 
     * @param dxConsumed Horizontal distance in pixels consumed by this view during this scroll step
     * @param dyConsumed Vertical distance in pixels consumed by this view during this scroll step
     * @param dxUnconsumed Horizontal scroll distance in pixels not consumed by this view
     * @param dyUnconsumed Horizontal scroll distance in pixels not consumed by this view
     * @param offsetInWindow Optional. If not null, on return this will contain the offset
      */
    public boolean dispatchNestedScroll(int dxConsumed, int dyConsumed,
            int dxUnconsumed, int dyUnconsumed, int[] offsetInWindow);

    /**
     * Dispatch one step of a nested scroll in progress before this view consumes any portion of it.
     *
     * <p>Nested pre-scroll events are to nested scroll events what touch intercept is to touch.
     * <code>dispatchNestedPreScroll</code> offers an opportunity for the parent view in a nested
     * scrolling operation to consume some or all of the scroll operation before the child view
     * consumes it.</p>
     *
     * @param dx Horizontal scroll distance in pixels
     * @param dy Vertical scroll distance in pixels
     * @param consumed Output. If not null, consumed[0] will contain the consumed component of dx
     *                 and consumed[1] the consumed dy.
     * @param offsetInWindow Optional. If not null, on return this will contain the offset
     *                       in local view coordinates of this view from before this operation
     *                       to after it completes. View implementations may use this to adjust
     *                       expected input coordinate tracking.
     * @return true if the parent consumed some or all of the scroll delta
     * @see #dispatchNestedScroll(int, int, int, int, int[])
     */
    public boolean dispatchNestedPreScroll(int dx, int dy, int[] consumed, int[] offsetInWindow);

    /**
     * Dispatch a fling to a nested scrolling parent.
     *
     * <p>This method should be used to indicate that a nested scrolling child has detected
     * suitable conditions for a fling. Generally this means that a touch scroll has ended with a
     * {@link VelocityTracker velocity} in the direction of scrolling that meets or exceeds
     * the {@link ViewConfiguration#getScaledMinimumFlingVelocity() minimum fling velocity}
     * along a scrollable axis.</p>
     *
     * <p>If a nested scrolling child view would normally fling but it is at the edge of
     * its own content, it can use this method to delegate the fling to its nested scrolling
     * parent instead. The parent may optionally consume the fling or observe a child fling.</p>
     *
     * @param velocityX Horizontal fling velocity in pixels per second
     * @param velocityY Vertical fling velocity in pixels per second
     * @param consumed true if the child consumed the fling, false otherwise
     * @return true if the nested scrolling parent consumed or otherwise reacted to the fling
     */
    public boolean dispatchNestedFling(float velocityX, float velocityY, boolean consumed);

    /**
     * Dispatch a fling to a nested scrolling parent before it is processed by this view.
     *
     * <p>Nested pre-fling events are to nested fling events what touch intercept is to touch
     * and what nested pre-scroll is to nested scroll. <code>dispatchNestedPreFling</code>
     * offsets an opportunity for the parent view in a nested fling to fully consume the fling
     * before the child view consumes it. If this method returns <code>true</code>, a nested
     * parent view consumed the fling and this view should not scroll as a result.</p>
     *
     * <p>For a better user experience, only one view in a nested scrolling chain should consume
     * the fling at a time. If a parent view consumed the fling this method will return false.
     * Custom view implementations should account for this in two ways:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>If a custom view is paged and needs to settle to a fixed page-point, do not
     *     call <code>dispatchNestedPreFling</code>; consume the fling and settle to a valid
     *     position regardless.</li>
     *     <li>If a nested parent does consume the fling, this view should not scroll at all,
     *     even to settle back to a valid idle position.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Views should also not offer fling velocities to nested parent views along an axis
     * where scrolling is not currently supported; a {@link android.widget.ScrollView ScrollView}
     * should not offer a horizontal fling velocity to its parents since scrolling along that
     * axis is not permitted and carrying velocity along that motion does not make sense.</p>
     *
     * @param velocityX Horizontal fling velocity in pixels per second
     * @param velocityY Vertical fling velocity in pixels per second
     * @return true if a nested scrolling parent consumed the fling
     */
    public boolean dispatchNestedPreFling(float velocityX, float velocityY);
